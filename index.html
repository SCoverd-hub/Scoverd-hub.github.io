			<p> I'm a Systems Administrator working for NC State University. I've starting college to increase my knowledge so I can get further in my career. The skills that I have acquired from working the the U.S. Navy as an IT, and now at State truly aren't enough to keep up with the innovation of technology today. I'm hoping to boost my career so that I can enjoy some hobbies I've been wanting to get into, however they cost a pretty penny hence the need for new skills.</p>
